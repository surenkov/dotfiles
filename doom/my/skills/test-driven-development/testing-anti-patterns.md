# Testing Anti-Patterns

## Core Principle
* **Rule:** Test what the code does, not what the mocks do. Mocks isolate dependencies; they are not the subject under test. Strict TDD prevents these anti-patterns.

## The Iron Laws

```
1. NEVER test mock behavior
2. NEVER add test-only methods to production classes
3. NEVER mock without understanding dependencies
```

## Anti-Pattern 1: Testing Mock Behavior

**The violation:**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Testing that the mock exists
test('renders sidebar', () => {
  render(<Page />);
  expect(screen.getByTestId('sidebar-mock')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

**Why This Fails:**
- You're verifying the mock works, not that the component works
- Test passes when mock is present, fails when it's not
- Tells you nothing about real behavior
**your human partner's correction:** "Are we testing the behavior of a mock?"

**The fix:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Test real component or don't mock it
test('renders sidebar', () => {
  render(<Page />);  // Don't mock sidebar
  expect(screen.getByRole('navigation')).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// OR if sidebar must be mocked for isolation:
// Don't assert on the mock - test Page's behavior with sidebar present
```

### Gate Function

BEFORE asserting on any mock element:
1. Ask: "Am I testing real component behavior or just mock existence?"
2. IF testing mock existence: **STOP** — Delete the assertion or unmock the component.
3. Test real behavior instead.

## Anti-Pattern 2: Test-Only Methods in Production

**The violation:**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: destroy() only used in tests
class Session {
  async destroy() {  // Looks like production API!
    await this._workspaceManager?.destroyWorkspace(this.id);
    // ... cleanup
  }
}

// In tests
afterEach(() => session.destroy());
```

**Why This Fails:**
- Production class polluted with test-only code
- Dangerous if accidentally called in production
- Violates YAGNI and separation of concerns
- Confuses object lifecycle with entity lifecycle

**The fix:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Test utilities handle test cleanup
// Session has no destroy() - it's stateless in production

// In test-utils/
export async function cleanupSession(session: Session) {
  const workspace = session.getWorkspaceInfo();
  if (workspace) {
    await workspaceManager.destroyWorkspace(workspace.id);
  }
}

// In tests
afterEach(() => cleanupSession(session));
```

### Gate Function

BEFORE adding any method to production class:
1. Ask: "Is this only used by tests?" IF yes: **STOP** — Put it in test utilities instead.
2. Ask: "Does this class own this resource's lifecycle?" IF no: **STOP** — Wrong class for this method.

## Anti-Pattern 3: Mocking Without Understanding

**The violation:**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Mock breaks test logic
test('detects duplicate server', () => {
  // Mock prevents config write that test depends on!
  vi.mock('ToolCatalog', () => ({
    discoverAndCacheTools: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined)
  }));

  await addServer(config);
  await addServer(config);  // Should throw - but won't!
});
```

**Why This Fails:**
- Mocked method had side effect test depended on (writing config)
- Over-mocking to "be safe" breaks actual behavior
- Test passes for wrong reason or fails mysteriously

**The fix:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Mock at correct level
test('detects duplicate server', () => {
  // Mock the slow part, preserve behavior test needs
  vi.mock('MCPServerManager'); // Just mock slow server startup

  await addServer(config);  // Config written
  await addServer(config);  // Duplicate detected ✓
});
```

### Gate Function

BEFORE mocking any method:
1. Ask: "What side effects does the real method have?"
2. Ask: "Does this test depend on any of those side effects?"
3. Ask: "Do I fully understand what this test needs?"
* **IF depends on side effects:** Mock at lower level (actual slow/external operation) or use test doubles that preserve necessary behavior. Do NOT mock high-level methods.
* **IF unsure:** Run test with real implementation FIRST, observe actual needs, then add minimal mocking at the right level.
* **Red flags:** Mocking "just to be safe", assuming slow execution, or mocking without understanding dependency chain.

## Anti-Pattern 4: Incomplete Mocks

**The violation:**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Partial mock - only fields you think you need
const mockResponse = {
  status: 'success',
  data: { userId: '123', name: 'Alice' }
  // Missing: metadata that downstream code uses
};

// Later: breaks when code accesses response.metadata.requestId
```

**Why this is wrong:**
- **Partial mocks hide structural assumptions** - You only mocked fields you know about
- **Downstream dependence:** Downstream code may depend on omitted fields, causing silent failures.
- **Tests pass but integration fails:** Mock incomplete, real API complete.
- **False confidence:** Test proves nothing about real behavior.
**The Iron Rule:** Mock the COMPLETE data structure as it exists in reality, not just fields your immediate test uses.

**The fix:**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Mirror real API completeness
const mockResponse = {
  status: 'success',
  data: { userId: '123', name: 'Alice' },
  metadata: { requestId: 'req-789', timestamp: 1234567890 }
  // All fields real API returns
};
```

### Gate Function

BEFORE creating mock responses:
1. Examine actual API response from docs/examples.
2. Include ALL fields the system might consume downstream.
3. Verify mock matches real response schema completely.
* **Critical:** Understand the ENTIRE structure before creating a mock. Partial mocks fail silently when code accesses omitted fields. If uncertain, include all documented fields.

## Anti-Pattern 5: Integration Tests as Afterthought

**The violation:**
```
✅ Implementation complete
❌ No tests written
"Ready for testing"
```

**Why this is wrong:**
*Testing is integral to implementation.* Cannot claim complete without tests.
*Fix (TDD Cycle):* 1. Write failing test → 2. Implement to pass → 3. Refactor → 4. Claim complete.

## When Mocks Become Too Complex

### Warning Signs
- Mock setup longer than test logic
- Mocking everything to make test pass
- Mocks missing methods real components have
- Test breaks when mock changes

*Partner Question:* "Do we need to be using a mock here?"
*Action:* Prefer integration tests with real components over complex mock hierarchies.

## TDD Prevents These Anti-Patterns

1. **Write test first** → Forces you to think about what you're actually testing
2. **Watch it fail** → Confirms test tests real behavior, not mocks
3. **Minimal implementation** → No test-only methods creep in
4. **Real dependencies** → You see what the test actually needs before mocking

## Quick Reference

| Anti-Pattern | Fix |
|--------------|-----|
| Assert on mock elements | Test real component or unmock it |
| Test-only methods in production | Move to test utilities |
| Mock without understanding | Understand dependencies first, mock minimally |
| Incomplete mocks | Mirror real API completely |
| Tests as afterthought | TDD - tests first |
| Over-complex mocks | Consider integration tests |

## Red Flags

- Assertion checks for `*-mock` test IDs
- Methods only called in test files
- Mock setup is >50% of test
- Test fails when you remove mock
- Can't explain why mock is needed
- Mocking "just to be safe"

## The Bottom Line

**Mocks are tools to isolate, not things to test.**
If TDD reveals you're testing mock behavior, test real behavior or question why you're mocking at all.
